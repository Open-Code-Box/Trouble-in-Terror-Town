Trouble in Terror Town (TTT) is a multiplayer standalone remake of a gamemode included with Garry’s Mod called Trouble in Terrorist Town. The game is about a group that has traitors among them, out to kill everyone who’s not a traitor.

When the game starts, a small number of players is selected as Traitors, who have to kill all the Innocent players (ie. the rest of the players). The Innocent players know they are in the majority, but they do not know who is a Traitor and who is not, but they have a Detective that can assist them with sniffing out the Traitors using his gadgets.

The Traitors must use the element of surprise and their special equipment to their advantage in order to succeed. The Innocent just have to survive and Detective has to save as many Innocents as possible, which means finding out who the Traitors are and eliminating them first. This is complicated by the fact that everyone is wielding lethal weaponry, and everyone looks suspicious…

If you’ve heard of non-digital party games like Werewolf or Mafia, or a digital game called Among Us it’s a bit like that but in 3D with guns.
